    <h1>The Euclidean Algorithm</h1>
    
    <p>In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, 
    <br> is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), 
    <br> the largest number that divides them both without a remainder.
    <br> It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid,
    <br> who first described it in his Elements (c. 300 BC).
    <br> It is an example of an algorithm, 
    <br>a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules, 
    <br>and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use.
    <br> It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, 
    <br>and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.</p>
